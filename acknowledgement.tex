I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. So Hon-cheong for offering me the opportunity to work with him. He teaches me how to conduct research works and gave me generous help in my daily life. He is humorous and highly empathic.  Truth to be told, it is a wonderful journey to study and work with him, and I am lucky to have the experience. 

I also would like to thank my wife. It's nearly ten years since the first meet, and she has become the most important person in my life. Thanks for supporting my decision to pursue a higher degree and bearing all burden from family to free me from distractions. This is not easy to her. You are a brave girl and wonderful mother for the kids. My any achievement is impossible without you. 

Thanks my father and mother for never saying NO to the decision of further my education and for taking care of my kids in the past years. I know the hardness for you to bear the burden. I highly appreciate the support.

Thanks my kids for tolerating my absence of parental responsibility for the past year. You let me be your father and share tremendous joy with me. I promise my love to you will alway be the same. 

Thanks my lab mates for having some awesome years with you. You are a part of my daily life in those years. The times we spent together will be a precious memory. 

Thanks everybody who helped me for their kindness!
