In general, we denote a scalar by an italic lower case letter,
a vector by a roman lower case bold letter,
and a matrix by a roman upper case bold letter respectively, e.g., 
$a \in \bbR $, $\mathbf{v} \in \bbR^n$ and $\mathbf{M} \in \bbR^{p \times q}$, with any exceptions to be mentioned in the context case by case.

An identity matrix is written as $\mathbf{I}$. Specifically, an $n\times n$ identity matrix is written as $\mathbf{I}_n$.
A zero matrix or vector is written as ${\bf 0}$. Specifically, an $m\times n$ zero matrix is written as ${\bf 0}_{m\times n}$.

Specialized symbols and major acronyms are defined as follows:
